    <h4>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef.</h4>

    <p>This recipe was given to my mother-in-law and it has become a treasured family recipe. The brisket is seared in a hot skillet to give it a caramelized surface when it's done, topped with sliced onions, garlic, and a drizzle of broth, then braised for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast. It's so worth the wait! I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips.</p>

    <p>It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®), or as desired</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
